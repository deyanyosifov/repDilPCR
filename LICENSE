The source code of the repDilPCR program is organized in three separate files: repDilPCR_lib.R, app.R and repDilPCR.R. repDilPCR_lib.R is the core of the program. It is a library of functions that is used by the other two scripts. app.R is a Shiny app that can be executed on a local computer or on a server providing the functions of the repDilPCR software to client computers.  app.R depends on repDilPCR_lib.R. repDilPCR.R is an R script that also provides all functions of the repDilPCR software but can be executed only locally on computers running R. It depends on repDilPCR_lib.R, too. Additionally, the program contains an exemplary csv file of test data (Test_data.csv) and a www folder with the logo of the program as a png file (repDilPCR_logo.png).
